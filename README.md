# Country-Clustering

This project applies machine learning techniques to cluster countries based on various economic, social, and demographic indicators. Using **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction and **KMeans & Agglomerative Clustering**, the project provides insights into country similarities.  


## **About Dataset**

Clustering the Countries by using Unsupervised Learning for HELP International Objective: To categorise the countries using socio-economic and health factors that determine the overall development of the country.

## **Features**  
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** PCA is used to extract the most relevant features.  
- **Clustering Algorithms:** Implementation of KMeans and Agglomerative clustering.  
- **Visualization:** Cluster results are plotted for better interpretation.  
- **Performance Evaluation:** Silhouette score used for assessing clustering quality.
